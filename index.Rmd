# Welcome

These notes contain my transcriptions and solutions to the exercises of the class Statistical Modelling II, taught at UT Austin during the Spring of 2018 by Sinead Williamson. If you find an error, it is most likely my own fault.

If you are reading this using the html-gitbook version, please use the left menu to navigate through the lists of exercises.
